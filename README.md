# Spotify Playlist Creation from CSV file
Create a Spotify playlist from an Excel or CSV file using the Spotify Web API.  I switched From Google Play Music to Spotify and there were no options to transfer 
playlists so I exported my playlists to a csv file.

You will need to edit your credentials in the secret file as well as the filename in the main script. The script will add songs not found to a separate tab in the file.
