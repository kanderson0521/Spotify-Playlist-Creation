# Spotify Playlist Creation from CSV file


<h5> This is based off a tutorial from YT, here is the original code: https://github.com/TheComeUpCode/SpotifyGeneratePlaylist </h5>


<h5> When creating this project I did not know Git very well and did not know about forking a project so I just included the link. </h5>


Create a Spotify playlist from an Excel or CSV file using the Spotify Web API.  I switched From Google Play Music to Spotify and there were no options to transfer 
playlists so I exported my playlists to a csv file. I wanted to keep it here to share with others who have the same issue. 

You will need to edit your credentials in the secret file as well as the filename in the main script. The script will add songs not found to a separate tab in the file.
